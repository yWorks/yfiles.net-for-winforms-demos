# 14 Using Data in Label Tag

Shows how to use data from a business object, which is stored in the label's tag,
for rendering.
  

This mechanism also applies to nodes, edges and ports.


In this example, a dummy business object, which only defines a color, is stored. This color
is used to set the background of the label. You can store any object you like in the tag
in order to use its data in the style.



Note that, in contrast to MySimpleNodeStyle, you can change the color of each label separately
without affecting other labels that use the same style instance.
