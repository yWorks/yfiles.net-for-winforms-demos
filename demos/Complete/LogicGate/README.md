# LogicGate

This demo shows how ports can be used to implement a digital system comprising logic gates and similar components.
      Each node in this system has specific ports for incoming and outgoing edges.
      To achieve this, Port Constraints are used as a mechanism to force layout algorithms to respect port locations and edge directions.
