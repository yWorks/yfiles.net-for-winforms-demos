# 02 Node Color

Shows how to create properties so that the style can be changed dynamically.
  

In this case the background color of the nodes can be set via
the Background property.


Please note that the color is the same for all nodes which share one style instance.
To set the color differently for another node, the node has to be assigned a different
style instance.
