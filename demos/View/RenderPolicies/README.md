# RenderPolicies

This demo shows the effect of different render policies on the graph items of a sample graph.
      The hierarchic nesting policy determines how and whether the position of a node in the 
      graph hierarchy affects its z-index and if edges are affected by their source and target nodes' position.
      Labels and Ports can either be rendered in separate label and port groups or directly at their owner.
