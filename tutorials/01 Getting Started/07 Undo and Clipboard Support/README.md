# 07 Undo and Clipboard Support

This demo shows how to use undo and clipboard functionality present in yFiles.NET.
  

Note that Clipboard functionality is already enabled by default. Also, CommandBindings for Clipboard
  operations and Undo/Redo are active by default, so apart from activating the UndoEngine, you only need have to bind your buttons/menu entries
  etc. to the default CommandBindings, as shown in the corresponding XAML
