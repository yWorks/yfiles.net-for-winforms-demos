# Option

This demo implements a generic framework to display and edit settings.
		  
It is used by several other demos, such as `Modules` and
		`GraphEditor`.
		
**This is legacy only code for older demos and should not be used as a starting point for new projects. Use the <c>OptionHandler</c> demo instead**
