# TableEditor

This demo shows how to use and manipulate `ITable` instances.
        

      We show how table nodes can be interactive manipulated (e.g. how to resize or reparent stripes, use drag and drop for stripes, change stripe labels etc.). Also
	  interaction with the layout engine is shown.
